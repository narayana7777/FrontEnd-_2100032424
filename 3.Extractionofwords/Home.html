come out before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? rm not getting in there! rm going to regret this. There goes
another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here, Are you
sure this things safe? Close up formation, You'd better let her loose, Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit! Negative, Negative! It didn't go in. It
